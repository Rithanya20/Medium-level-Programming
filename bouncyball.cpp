/*
A ball is dropped from a height H (meters), it bounces back to a height of B*H where B is the bouncing factor and 0<B<1. Calculate the total distance travelled by the ball before coming to rest while dropped from a height H on a surface with a bouncing factor of B. When height is less than 1m, ball does not bounce back.
Input:  
H=5, B=0.5â€‹
Output:  
12.5  
Explanation :  
5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 1.25 + 1.25
